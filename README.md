# Deep dive into Machine learning by leveraging Networks 

A group project attempt to understand Networks and their vast applications in Recommeder systems, Google's PageRank, DeepMind's AlphaFold, drug side effects, traffc prediction,
weather forecasting and other powerful applications. We aim to create Knowledge Graphs for Philosophy articles, to capture semantic relationships between authors, works, school of thoughts and the history of philosophy. We will then convert these KGs to KG embeddings using BERT-KG and other relevant transformers. Finally we will apply link prediction, entity classification and other tasks utilising different Graph Neural Networks.
